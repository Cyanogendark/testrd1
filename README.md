# IPTV Checker
A fast and efficient IPTV checker, made for every type of IPTV playlists.

## Legal terms

No channel is inside this program. I am not responsible for any illegal actions you might make using this program.
Note that Xtream-Codes servers are often borderline when it comes to copyrighted content being restreamed. 
The fact that this program supports server overlooking is only for **observation purposes** and not for illegal activity.

## How does it work ?

There's many ways of loading a playlist file : either you load a playlist URL, or you can import a m3u file locally stored in your computer.
Once you've loaded it, just click on the "Check" button and let the magic happen.

## Specific cases

### iptv-org

The playlists coming from this repository might contain links that aren't available all the time, or that are blocked in your country.
To prevent such cases, I've ignored them when adding those to the playlist.

### Xtream-Codes servers (WIP)

Those servers are interesting in many aspects.

1) You can get easy access to the status of the servers (on older versions of the Xtream API, including Reborn) by clicking on "Get Server Status".
2) If you give the program a single channel link, you also can see all the channels that are contained in the Xtream-Codes server by clicking on "Get Server Channels".

## What makes this program interesting ?

1) Integrated Xtream-Codes server looking support (Work In Progress)
2) Check the link's country origin
3) Efficiency and fast checking

## How can I help ?

Simply fork the program or make an issue if there's something you would like to see on the program to be added or something that needs to be fixed.
Note that I'm not an "excellent" programmer too and that I can make coding mistakes or optimizations could be made, so don't hesitate to tell me or to make a PR to reflect those changes.
